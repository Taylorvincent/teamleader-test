# Teamleader challenge

## Stack

This project uses Next.js, a framework on top of React. Besides cool things like static generation, it also gives us nice starting config out of the box. 

To get started on the challenge even faster I just copied my portfolio code to this repository to avoid a new setup.


## Running the code

```
  npm install
```
or 
```
  yarn
```
