# Teamleader challenge

## Stack

This project uses Next.js, a framework on top of React. Besides cool things like static generation, it also gives us nice starting config out of the box. 

To get started on the challenge faster I just copied my portfolio code to this repository to avoid a new setup.


## Running the code

```
  npm install
```

```
  npm run dev
```

This will launch a development server @ http://localhost:3000


## Entry point

The above url will enter the code/page located at [./src/pages/index.tsx](./src/pages/index.tsx).
